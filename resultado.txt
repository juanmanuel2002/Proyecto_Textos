Negative Examples:
  - comparing equal or thinner than 1 mm melanomas and thicker ones, epidermal disarray, cells in sheetlike structures, cerebriform nests and nucleated cells within dermal papilla were significantly associated with thick melanomas
  - no lesions excised for cosmetic reasons or solely due to a patient request were included

Negative Examples:
  - however, immunosuppressant drugs are associated with an increased risk of certain cancers
  - in the escape process, tumor cells escape this con trol through genetic or epigenetic changes resulting in clinically observable malignant disease 1
  - due to this close connection between the immune sys tem and melanoma, we can expect that immunosuppres sive or immunomodulating drugs affect this balance
  - a retrospec tive casecontrol study found that among renal trans plant recipients, the use of cyclosporine was associated with a 1
  - however, one ret rospective casecontrol study found that among renal transplant patients, the use of sirolimus was associated with a hazard ratio of 1
  - this suggests that natali zumab exposure could be associated with the develop ment of melanoma
  - animal models demonstrate that il12 defi ciency is associated with a higher risk of skin tumors 57
  - on the other hand, il23 is associated with a th17 response and has protumorigenic effects of decreasing cd8 tcell infiltration and increasing angiogenesis 58,59
  - azathioprine azathioprine, and its active compound 6mercaptop urine is an antimetabolite which antagonizes purine metabolism and inhibits the synthesis of dna and rna, resulting in decreased numbers of circulating b and t lymphocytes
  - inconclusive melanoma risk methotrexate methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite that binds to dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase, resulting in decreased reduced folates, purines and pyri midines
  - however, a conclusion could not be drawn regarding the risk of melanoma in patients treated with cyclophosphamide due to an insuf ficient number of cases
  - the following immunomodulating agents have been found to be associated with an increased risk of melanoma or to have an inconclusive association with melanoma cyclosporine, sirolimus, natalizumab, il6 inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and the tnfalpha inhibitors infliximab and etanercept
  - thus, if there are no equal alternative agents, we recommend dermatologic followup every 6 months while taking the medication
  - therefore, we recommend avoidance of agents associ ated with an increased melanoma risk or inconclusive risk in patients with any history of invasive melanoma, and dermatologic followup every 6 months if there are no available alternative therapies
  - there appears to be epidemiologic evidence that some immunosup pressive drugs, including cyclosporine, natalizumab and sirolimus are associated with melanoma
  - therefore, we recommend all patients with a history of invasive mel anoma to avoid these agents due to their baseline high risk of melanoma

Negative Examples:
  - thus, the ratio of incidence to mortality in females is two to three times as high as in males from ages 20 to 40 years the dif ference in ratios becomes smaller with increasing age until it is approximately equal in males and females age 80Ã¾ years
  - although an incongruent rise in incidence versus mortality over time might be due to an increase in true cancer occurrence plus effective secondary prevention miti gating the rise in observed mortality or causing lead time bias, these factors appear unlikely
  - if effective secondary prevention was the primary factor leading to a decrease in mortality, one would additionally expect a decrease in the 5 0 30 35 40 45 50 55 age 60 65 70 75 80 85 0 10 20 ratio 30 40 mm and mis incidencemortality 25 50 75 100 125 per 100,000 personyears 150 175 c mm and mis incidence 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 female sex male 45 age 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 per 100,000 personyears 30 35 a b mortality 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 female sex male female sex male 45 age 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 figure 3
  - these lesions are most prevalent in younger females, present as dermal nodules, and are associated with falsepositive melanoma diagnoses dika et al
  - a decline in true occurrence risk could be due to effective primary prevention and possibly the suc cessful removal of potential melanoma precursors that is, congenital and dysplastic nevi
  - in particular, the 1920se1940s were characterized by a zealous enthusiasm for uvr exposure as a panacea for health albert and ostheimer, 2003 sorene, 2015, and the skin of young children was not uncommonly exposed to uvr lamps by the medical community sorene, 2015
  - unique agerelated differences in mel anoma risk by sex could be due to indoor tanning, which is more prevalent in young females centers for disease control and prevention, 2012

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.96
Negative Examples:
  - therefore, the original nomenclature has sometimes been retained in this review
  - consequently, the phrase oc ular melanoma is currently discouraged
  - this may cause some confusion in interpreting the older liter ature e
  - 44 thus, in the early years of the 19th century, the concepts of melanoma and mel anosis were not distinct
  - it must be distinguished from junctional nevi, racial melano sis, congenital ocular, or oculodermal melanosis, as well as from pigmentation due to systemic diseases e
  - the concept of intransit metastases could in part explain the occur rence of multifocal conjunctival melanoma how ever, multifocal disease will most often appear as new primary tumors associated with pigmented or fig
  - while most multifocal melanomas thus appear to originate from pam, isolated cases may arise from conjunctival nevi
  - 142 even by histopathologic examination some nevus variants may cause confusion
  - thus, ad justing for referral bias, approximately 1 per 10,000 surgical procedures in ophthalmology may involve excision of a conjunctival melanoma
  - 57,235 pos sibly, melanoma associated with pam may present in the canine conjunctiva
  - ultraviolet radiation massive data now clearly indicate that high doses of ultraviolet radiation uvr may cause skin mela noma
  - similarly, a few casecontrol studies sug gest that substantial exposure to uvr is associated with a smalltomoderate increased risk of harboring uveal melanoma relative risk ranging from 1
  - thus, the risk for malignant transformation in the individual with a minute patch of pigmented conjunctiva appears to be minimal
  - 128 this condition is associated with darker skin types, being more common in heavily pigmented individuals, and is usually bilateral
  - 84 thus, accepting that both of these lesions may be present in the conjunctiva, there is a potential risk of pam being overdiagnosed in the absence of clearly defined criteria for differ entiating small areas of pam from ephelides
  - 271 thus, the clinical dilemma persists in sep arating flat pigmented lesions unlikely to progress to melanoma from those with a high risk of malignant transformation
  - 65,125,293 it is therefore advised that any conjunctival nevus with signs of enlarge ment in adulthood should be excised
  - the transitional zones be tween skin and conjunctiva include the caruncle a roundish body at the medial canthus lined by con junctival epithelium, but with a stroma featuring the adnexal structures otherwise only present in the dermis
  - 104 the im plications of this dual appearance are unclear, but data indicate that patients with conjunctival mela noma associated with ipsilateral pigmentation of the eyelid margin do worse in one study, 12 of 17 pa tients with conjunctival melanoma, including associ ated eyelid pigmentation ranging from increased pigmentation of the melanocytes to invasive cutane ous melanoma, died of metastatic disease
  - the remaining indi vidual probably had sporadic dysplastic nevi, but also proved to have a conjunctival melanoma associated with pam
  - thus, the literature currently includes two, or possibly three, individuals with conjunctival melanoma in the setting of the dns d1 phenotype
  - association with other entities or conditions similar to malignant melanoma in other locations, conjunctival melanoma appears to be associated with neural crest disorders like neurofibromatosis
  - 297,303 in contrast to the uveal tract, ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis are not associated with malignant melanocytic transformation of the conjunctiva
  - the thin conjunctival specimen tends to curl during fixa tion unless mounted flat, and, potentially, a curved conjunctival specimen may cause a false diagnosis of pagetoid spread when only basilar hyperplasia is present
  - 80 therefore, the biopsy specimen should be placed flat onto an absorbent mount before fixation
  - 93 therefore, orbital exenteration should probably be reserved as a palliative treatment for advanced stages of conjunctival melanoma that have entered an aggressive phase
  - 281 cryotherapy can generate symblepharon and motility disturbances, and it may cause loss of cilia and a dry eye
  - 40,149 brachytherapy may cause conjunctival teleangiectasia, corneal ul ceration, and lens opacities
  - charged particle irradiation using helium ions and proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanoma may cause anterior segment complications such as dry eye, eye lash loss, and neovascular glaucoma in some 2030 of patients
  - 48,110,112 however, data on side ef fects related to proton beam treatment for conjunc tival melanoma are minimal, but some of the com plications associated with proton beam therapy for uveal melanoma can arise with the addition of cor neal melting
  - therefore, it is currently advised that surface cytology should be used judiciously and not replace biopsy for sus pected neoplastic conditions
  - 67 whereas some data suggest that recurrent disease is associated with the development of metastases,67 other reports are conflicting
  - 230 some data suggest that recurrent disease is more common in conjuncti val melanoma associated with pam, but also that tu mors that histologically appear incompletely excised may not necessarily recur
  - 132 in sweden, all causes of death are filed with the na tional causes of death registry, which is linked to the national cancer registry
  - thus, the 5year tumorrelated mortality rate in case series with conjunctival mela noma is 1219, whereas the 10year mortality rate is 2330
  - tumor depth and size the prognosis for cutaneous melanomas is inti mately associated with tumor thickness37 and grade table 4 summary of prognostic studies 1950 through 1996 comprising patients with conjunctival melanoma authors year reference  study design patients mortality  comments ash 1950 14 case series 60 9 survival data on 45 patients
  - , those involving the palpebral conjunctiva, fornices, plica, caruncle, and lid margins were associated with 2
  - tumor cell proliferation a high capacity for growth is reflected in the rela tive or total number of tumor cells that feature mi totic figures and in conjunctival melanoma a high mitotic rate is associated with an adverse progno sis
  - this nuclear pro tein may be used to enhance the sensitivity in detect ing cycling cells and the total number of tumor cells per square millimeter featuring immunoreactivity is strongly associated with a poor prognosis, even after adjusting for possible confounding factors
  - poor prognosis is associated with thick tu mors and tumors arising from the palpebral or caruncular conjunctiva
  - it would therefore seem appropriate to look for cytogenetic abnormalities similar to those that are currently being unraveled in skin melanoma

Negative Examples:
  - therefore, melanoma ranks second to adult leukemia in terms of loss of years of potential life, per death
  - adjuvant interferon has been associated with improved diseasefree survival, but its impact on overall survival is unclear
  - adjuvant interferon has been associated with improved diseasefree survival, but its impact on overall survival is unclear
  - l n o p q t adjuvant interferon has been associated with improved diseasefree survival, but its impact on overall survival is unclear
  - a higher radiotherapy dose is associated with more durable palliation and longer survival in patients with metastatic melanoma
  - 7administration of multiagent regimens and highdose interleukin2 is complex and associated with significant toxicities
  - 1012 in the evidencebased derivation of the 2010 ajcc staging system, mitotic rate greater than or equal to 1 per mm2 was inde pendently associated with worse diseasespecific sur vival, especially in patients with melanoma less than or equal to 1
  - therefore, mitotic rate has replaced clark level as a criterion for upstaging pa tients with melanomas less than or equal to 1
  - 0 mm, wider margins were associated with a slightly lower rate of combined localregional nodal recurrence, but not improvement in local re currence alone or melanomaspecific survival
  - slnb was also associated with low falsenegative and complication rates
  - 6264 thus, in these highrisk patients, offering slnb would seem reasonable to help define prognostically homo geneous groups for participation in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy
  - 80 review of data combined from the randomized controlled trials found that adjuvant interferon alfa was not associated with improved overall survival in patients with melanoma who were at increased risk for recurrence
  - 83 concluded that although highdose interferon alfa is associated with improved diseasefree survival in patients with highrisk primary melanomas, the role of adjuvant interferon for those with intermediate to highrisk melanoma remains undefined
  - therefore, the main option for adjuvant therapy in this setting is participation in a clinical trial
  - 96 however, a modified hyperthermic iso lated limb perfusion procedure was associated with a higher complete response rate of 63, with 5year survival observed in 38 of patients
  - 90 systemic therapy traditional chemotherapy metastatic melanoma is associated with a poor prognosis
  - skin complications were frequently associated with the agent 18 of vemurafenibtreated patients developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or ker atoacanthoma that required simple excision, whereas 12 experienced grade 2 or 3 photosensitivity skin reactions
  - ipilimumab is associated with the potential for serious autoimmune toxicity, clini cal responses may take months to become apparent, and the overall response rate is less than 20
  - vemurafenib, on the other hand, is associated with a 40 to 50 response rate in patients with a v600 mutated braf gene, and responses may be seen days to weeks after starting the drug
  - 123125 a recent metaanalysis also showed that although biochemotherapy improved overall response rates, it was not associated with a survival benefit in pa tients with metastatic melanoma
  - however, increasing risk of systemic or brain relapse was associated with higher substage, with stage iiic having a 48 risk of nonbrain recurrence and a 13 risk of brain involve ment
  - 138141 therefore, frequent imaging should not be part of the routine followup for all patients
  - a higher radiotherapy dose is associated with more durable palliation and longer survival in patients with metastatic melanoma

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.76
Negative Examples:
  - the efficiency of these treatments can be decreased due to the development of diverse resistance mechanisms
  - 14 two types of limitations are relevant in melanoma therapy 1 adverse events aes, which can lead to skin and gastrointestinal toxicity, can be high and usually related to immune reactions and lack of specificity for tumor cells1517 and 2 reduced efficiency, which can occur due to resistance to immune, chemotargeted and intralesional therapies
  - 48 primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy is common and may be due to the lack of recognition by tcells, as described above
  - high and intermediate dose showed no complete response differ ences, and thus the therapeutic dose should be reconsidered
  - 66,67 in melanomas, tregs appear in periph eral circulation and in the tme and seem to be associated with poor clinical outcome
  - 85,89,90 this engineered nonpathogenic viral strain is injected directly into a metastatic melanoma nodule and while it enters into both normal and malignant cells, it only replicates in the melanoma cells, leading to tumor cell lysis and the release of tumorspecific antigens
  - preclinical models showed that gp100 peptide monotherapy had unsatisfactory clinical benefits therefore, it might be used as adjuvant therapy
  - thus, combined therapies of cart cells with a pd1 antibody or a ctla4 antibody might overcome the tme features
  - however, bct did not show improvement in os and it was associated with severe toxicity and risk of brain metastases development
  - these onco genic mutations may be associated with melanoma cell pro liferation and a malignant phenotype
  - 119 mutations in the braf gene are associated with activation of the mapk signaling pathway and with increased growth and proliferation of cancer cells
  - 122 however, the clinical benefit of these therapies is limited, due to the rapid development of multiple mechanisms of resistance, such as elevated expression of the kinases craf, cot1, or mutant braf, activated mutations in nras, mek1, or akt1, aberrant splicing of braf, activation of phosphati dylinositol3oh kinase pi3k via the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog pten, and persistent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases
  - mutations on key signaling oncogenes, used as targets for melanoma therapy, are associated with melanoma cell proliferation, cellcycle progression, and malignant phenotype
  - 122,138 ckit mutations have been reported across several exons and were associated with the development of drug resistance
  - 122 vegf inhibitors melanomas express high levels of vegf, vegfr1, vegf r2, and vegfr3 which are associated with poor prognosis, immune suppression, and growth of tumor neovascula ture
  - 145 therefore, vegf blockade may be a useful approach for melanoma therapy
  - 148 activation of the mtor pathway was described in cutaneous melanoma, associated with the presence of braf mutations and with poor prognosis
  - 155 cyclindependent kinase cdk inhibitors in familial melanomas, 2 are associated with germline mutations in cdk4
  - thus, the development of selective inhibitors of erbb4 may help in the treatment of melanomas
  - moreover, patient and tumor heterogeneity are associated with different mechanisms of resistance, which influence negatively clinical outcomes in melanomas
  - mtor pathway activation in cutaneous melanoma is associated with poorer prognosis character istics

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.53
Negative Examples:
  - thus, new biomarkers and drug targets are needed to improve the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and treatment
  - the darker eumelanin is a better uv shield, and consequently people with darker skin have a lower skin cancer risk
  - 35 pheomelanin has been shown to produce more ultravioletainduced reactive oxidative species ros leading to greater dna damage in response to uv radiation
  - 1 people harboring less func tional variants of mc1r accumulate more mutations due to increased exposure of the nuclei to uv damage
  - 11,12 p16 binds to cdk4 leading to cell cycle arrest, while mutations in p16 prevent its binding to cdk4 thus disrupting cell cycle arrest
  - diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma the early classification of melanoma was based on where the tumor arose from existing nevus, acquired melanocytic lesion, blemish free skin, but in the 1960s a prominent dermatologist, wallace clark, suggested that melanoma ought to be classified based on histological features instead, thus revolutionizing the way melanoma was diagnosed
  - mutations in nras, braf, gnaq and ckit lead to constitutive mapk signaling leading to unbridled proliferation and survival
  - 37 these applications could be a very useful tool for mela noma diagnosis if accuracy could be improved and if strict reg ulatory oversight was ensured,37,38 however, experts caution that reliance on theseapplications asthey arecurrently availablehasthe potential to harm patients through a false sense of security, poten tially resulting in delayed diagnosis
  - therefore, it is unsurprising that the use of ihc for the diagnosis of melanoma has significantly increased over the last 20 years
  - 70,74,8287 several epigenetic modifications have been linked to mel anoma
  - 90 92 ezh2 and h3k27me3 have also been shown to regulate expression of the cell adhesion molecule ecadherin, and ezh2 overexpression results in downregulation of ecadherin, leading to a decrease in cellular adhesion and increase in cell mobility and invasiveness
  - the battle between the immune system and malignant tumors, therefore, comes down to a tumors ability to evolve mechanisms to escape immune detection before the immune system can destroy the tumor
  - 103 in the equilibrium phase the cancer cells are constantly growing but are suppressed by the immune cells, therefore, the growth and expansion of cancer cells is counterbalanced by the immune system
  - 71,103 due to the highly mutagenic nature of melanoma cells, they quickly develop mechanisms to evade the immune response
  - therefore, the sideeffects of checkpoint inhibiters can be severe
  - when pd1 binds to the pdl12 expressed by tumor cells, this leads to deactivation of tcells
  - b antibodies against ctla4, pd1 or pdl12 prevent binding to associated ligands leading to activation of tcells and stimulation of an immune response to tumor cells
  - ihc scoring can be subjective, and thus developing diagnostic systems using multiple biomarkers will require coincident development of strict interpretation criteria and standardiza tion procedures to ensure reproducibility from laboratory to laboratory and between pathologists
  - drugs that will not help a patient will not be administered, and it will also reduce patient suffering due to side effects of treatments that will be ineffective for them

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.87
Negative Examples:
  - among cutaneous melanoma, superï¬cial spreading melanoma ssm is the most common type, especially among fairskinned individuals, and tends to carry a good prognosis due to a low breslow thickness, which also depends on the earlier time of diagnosis
  - mortality an estimated 57,000 people died of melanoma in 2020, according to globocan figure 3, resulting in agestandardized mortality of 0
  - uva seems to have a lower rate of dna repair and a consequently higher rate of mutations per photoproduct in melanocytes 14
  - uveal melanoma is not associated with chronic sun damage or mapk mutations, but rather with mutations in gnaq and gna11 20
  - uvinduced mutations in tumorsuppressor p53 are more commonly seen in those with stage iv disease and are associated with a worse prognosis 15
  - 9 million men use tanning beds annually, although the international agency for research on cancer iacr identiï¬ed tanning bed radiation as a carcinogen due to higher levels of uva and uvb exposure than that of the daily sun for most latitudes 23

Negative Examples:
  - therefore, randomized phase iii studies with sorafenib failed to show beneï¬t in patients with met astatic melanoma harboring braf mutations
  - 19 clinically, nras mutations appear to be most commonly associated with elderly age
  - 25 it should be noted that this set of additional mutations are yet to provide clinically signiï¬cant therapeutic targets and therefore are not routinely tested unless available in the setting of a clinical trial
  - 27 additional immunologic modalities involving quantitative expression of programmed death ligand 1 pd l1, although beneï¬cial in the prognosis and treatment for a variety of various solid tumor types, have only exhibited trends in os beneï¬ts for patients with melanoma who possess high pdl1 expression and therefore are yet to provide sufï¬cient evidence of their clinical utility
  - 31 these changes have aided in further risk stratiï¬cation and treatment planning, as met astatic involvement of viscera outside of the cns, desig nated as m1c, and cnsinvolved disease m1d are associated with a poorer prognosis than those with distant metastatic disease of the skin and soft tissue m1a and lung m1b, respectively
  - 43,44 the use of whole brain radiation in the ad juvant setting, however, exhibited no clinical improvement in cognition or survival and therefore is not recom mended
  - 49 this therapeutic modality has faced major shortcomings and associated challenges in achieving a prolonged ther apeutic beneï¬t given its short halflife with a relatively high toxicity proï¬le, including a potentially fatal vascular leak syndrome, thus requiring inpatient management to ad minister
  - 51 the oral alkylating agent, temozolomide, gained additional attention for its oral route of administration, enhanced patientreported quality of life, and potential ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier, leading to enhanced responses for patients with cns involvement, but ultimately provided no additional therapeutic beneï¬ts compared with those re ceiving dacarbazine
  - 54 finally, the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel, with or without vascular endothelial growth factor vegf inhibition by bevacizumab, exhibited modest improvements in disease control but were also associated with high rates of toxicity and unclear survival beneï¬ts
  - therapeutic approaches therefore require further prospective studies including more carefully deï¬ned patient cohorts, with current con siderations of imatinib versus clinical trials for patients with acral or mucosal melanomas harboring activating kit mutations who progress on or are ineligible for ici therapy
  - 114,115 however, the most durable responses after treatment discontinuation appear to be limited to patients who have achieved a cr during their initial treatment, and therefore, a much more extensive understanding of the clinical characteristics and biomarkers associated with continuous responses after the discontinuation of systemic therapies is required before safely endorsing the discontinuation of these lifeprolonging agents
  - 118 we therefore currently advise the continuation of ici therapy in patients who are responding but yet to achieve a cr and continuation of targeted therapies for even responding patients who may achieve a cr until disease progression or doselimiting toxicity, whereas more reliable methods in predictive risk stratiï¬cation and biomarker monitoring may eventually permit discontinuation in select cohorts of patients
  - 128130 in melanoma cell lines, yang et al131 showed that the vegf, il6, and il8 pathways associated with the neuroendo crine stress response were abrogated by the use of pro pranolol, a nonselective inhibitor of badrenergic receptor signaling pathways
  - 137 more extensive studies with longerterm follow up are therefore required to adequately investigate the utility of this therapeutic modality
  - 165 additional act with tcell receptor gene transfer to human lymphocytes with resultant binding to the cognate epitope of major histo compatibility complex molecules on target cells provided reasonable response rates but with added risks of severe toxicity proï¬les because of shared antigen expression and therefore will beneï¬t from investigation and development of germlinespeciï¬c antigens for future melanomaspeciï¬c efforts through this modality

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.54
Negative Examples:
  - therefore, we decided to use the technique known as transfer learning, which uses a network pretrained using a very large generalpurpose database, and subsequently retrains it using an smaller, stage 2 classification of the cropped bounding box using resnet152 convolutional net generation of candidates feature extraction cropped image stage 1 cropping a bounding box around the skin lesion using mask r_cnn refining the bounding box and cropping the image original image malignant or benign class fully connected net fig
  - for our application, the resnet152 classifies between malignant or benign classes, thus resulting in a binary classifier whose performance is evaluated using specific ity, sensitivity, accuracy and balance accuracy metrics, in which the reference class is the malignant class
  - to obtain model 2, a 90 transform augmentation is applied on the dermatoscopic images from the malig nant class, thus increasing the balance ratio between the two classes from 0
  - while there is also a drop in the number of benign samples correctly classified, it is not nearly as significant, therefore model 2 is postulated as a better model since it achieves a better balance in specificity ver sus sensitivity than model 1
  - therefore, we are of the opinion that to get an improvement in classifier per formance, if we include new images then these need to be of the same nature, i
  - in the case of melanoma, there may be involvement of the surrounding tissue, manifesting with metastatic lesions in transit, which are of poor progno sis or with satellite lesions that are locoregional cutane ous manifestations of dissemination as a consequence of embolization of tumor cells between the primary tumor and the regional lymph node therefore, these lesions are highly predictive of lymphatic invasion and predict the development of disseminated disease 37, 38

Negative Examples:
  - therefore, the lm group included a total of 81 lm biopsyproven areas with matching rcm images, comprising 61 biopsies from within the lesions themselves and 20 further perilesional biopsies collected for peripheral margin determination
  - in contrast, the atypical cobblestone pattern, particularly when com posed of small nucleated cells figure 2, was strongly associated with lm or of 13
  - 5 mm2, they were strongly associated with lm, with ors 47
  - dermal nests were very rare 7 out of 81 lms and more associated with lm or of 4
  - plump bright cells, particularly sparse within the papillary dermis, were strongly associated with the lms or of 5
  - broadened reticulated collagen fibers were mostly associated with bms of the face 58, whereas collagen bundles were mostly associated with lm but were present in only 14 of biopsies
  - the fact that size is an important feature for the diagnosis of lm may be due to the reason that numerous bms of the face show some melanocytic hyperplasia andor hyperpigmented kerati nocytes that may be interpreted under confocal micro scopy as small pagetoid cells
  - some other pathology components of classical lm such as thin epidermis, solar elastosis corresponding to collagen bundles, and melanophages corresponding to plump bright cells were also found to be more closely associated with lm, but were less significant than the aforementioned criteria
  - it is noteworthy that keratoses were less easy to differentiate from lms than other bms of the face, perhaps due to the distortion of pigmented keratinocytes that had a similar reflectance signal under rcm to atypical melanocytes

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.83
Negative Examples:
  - here we show that resistance programs include 1 the loss of wildtype antigen expression, resulting from tumorintrinsic ifnÎ³ signaling and melanoma de differentiation, 2 the disruption of antigen presentation via multiple inde pendent mechanisms affecting mhc expression, and 3 immune cell exclu sion associated with pten loss
  - mechanisms associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance have been reported in a small subset of patients, although no single resistance effector is strongly associated with resistance6
  - defects in ifnÎ³ signaling which also prevent ifnÎ³induced mhc expression have been identiï¬ed in 410 of pd1resistant melanomas and are often due to lossof function mutations in the ifnÎ³ effector kinases jak1 and jak29,16
  - recent studies have identiï¬ed features within the tumor microenvironment and the gut microbiome that are associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance, but the precise fig
  - for instance, poor responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with limited gut microbiome diversity and gut inï¬ammation1722, induced expression of immune checkpoint molecules including pdl1, lag 3, tim32327, and immune cell exclusion within the tumor microenvironment28
  - these programs include 1 the concurrent genetic and epigenetic disruption of the mhc proteins, 2 diminished expression of wildtype antigens via de differentiation and tumorintrinsic ifnÎ³ signaling, and 3 immune cell exclusion associated with pten loss and brain metastasis
  - thus, ifnÎ³ treatment of scc160016 cells did not induce stat1 phosphorylation fig
  - thus, tumor cells with intrinsic ifnÎ³ activity occur in a tumor microenvironment with a paucity of activated cd8 effector t cells
  - the differential effects of melana peptide pulsing on t cell activation were not due to differences in mhci expression in these pd1 prog cell lines fig
  - the low expression of ciita in smu170263 and scc110270 pd1 progs was not due to sequence alterations within the gene or pro moter supplementary data s5 but rather reï¬ected changes in histone acetylation
  - diminished immune cell inï¬ltration is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitorresistant brain tumors five pd1 prog melanoma cell lines had lossoffunction alterations affecting the pten tumor suppressor gene
  - of the two remaining pd1resistant brain melanoma tumors, high cd45 immune cell inï¬ltration was associated with accumulation of immune suppressive myeloid cells smu170263, fig
  - mhc class i and ii homozygosity is associated with reduced survival after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, although this effect is inï¬uenced by the expression of the hla allele, the hla supertype, and the tumor mutation burden12
  - third, a smaller subset of pd1 inhibitorresistant melanomas 522 23 show lossoffunction mutations in the pten gene, and this was associated with a paucity of immune cells and brain metastases
  - in melanoma, loss of pten is associated with decreased inï¬ltration and function of tumorinï¬ltrating t cells, possibly due to overexpression of immunosuppressive cytokines31, and shorter time to brain metastasis in patients with brafmutant highrisk stage iii melanoma39
  - this program can be driven by cytokines including tnfÎ±, tgfÃ, and ifnÎ³ and may be reversible upon removal of the stimuli13,49 thus, the transient induction of dedifferentiation is reï¬ective of an active immune response33
  - thus, it is likely that the nature and duration of the dedifferentiation switch, and the contribution of melanocytic antigens to immune mediated tumor response13, determine the role of this program in treatment resistance
  - we have also previously reported that de differentiation is associated with the suppression of mhci expression10
  - for instance, disruption of mhci andor mhcii antigen presentation due to genetically based resistance mechanisms such as jak1, jak2, and b2m lossoffunction mutations or epigenetic down regulation of ciita can be circumvented by activating innate immune receptors using tolllike receptor agonists or dsrna analogues5254

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.63
Negative Examples:
  - a greater understanding of early diagnosis and management of cm is urgently needed because of the high mortality rates due to metastatic melanoma
  - studies reported that 70 of cm cells had affected the cdkn2a gene due to somatic mutations
  - the three countries with the highest occur rence rate of cm are european countries, such as denmark, sweden and the netherlands and the incidence of cm is posi tively associated with the age group of above 75 years 7, 8
  - increased age is associated with a more unsatisfactory outcome
  - a higher mortality rate than spread confined to different locations is often associated with pulmonary, hepatic and brain metastasis
  - the melanoma clinical diagnosis is based on morphological criteria analysis and is thus sub jective and can be challenging for dermatologists and general practitioners
  - superficial shave biop sies might misjudge breslow thickness, ultimately mislabeling cms stage and are thus not encouraged for diagnosis of cm 19, 22
  - incisionalpartial biopsies have not yet been shown to im pact patient outcomes adversely due to the transfer of melano ma cells into blood vessels or cutaneous lymphatics
  - due to availability, noninvasive ap proaches such as optical coherence tomography, gene expres sion analysis, electrical impedance spectroscopy and reflec tance confocal microscopy are more useful 2527
  - the probability of melanoma death is causally linked to breslows primary lesion thickness, and there is a strong association between the thickness of the tumor and the delay in reporting the lesion as suspicious 30
  - due to the skin must be cooled to emphasize temperature variations, this approach is presently technically tricky as the sophisticated motion control is important when capturing a thermal image to compensate for the patients movement 46
  - it was found that programmed cell death protein 1 pd1 immunohistochemistry assays done on tumor specimens are not markers of choice to determine pd1 inhibitor treat ment response due to the heterogeneity in clinical trials 51
  - several genetic and im munohistochemical markers associated with the diagnosis of cm were summarized in table 4 5479
  - interferonÎ± treatment might be offered to patients with stage ii and iii melanoma as an adjuvant treatment, as these treatments increase infectionfree survival time but disap point due to toxicity
  - progression in cutaneous ma lignant melanoma is associated with distinct expression profiles a tissue microarraybased study
  - mcl1, bclxl and stat3 expres sion are associated with progression of melanoma whereas bcl2, ap2 and mitf levels decrease during progression of melanoma

Negative Examples:
  - in order of importance, these features were cerebriform nests, atypical cobblestone pattern with small nucleated cells in the epidermis, marked cytological atypia, and pagetoid cells, and disarranged epidermal layer with no honey comb recognized in some areas were associated with the mm diagnosis
  - large interpapillae spaces filled with honeycomb or cobblestone aspect was negatively associated with mms
  - pathology review showed that three were earlystage lentigo maligna, three were classic lentigo maligna, two were in situ mms of superficial spreading type associated with nevi, three were thin o1
  - 0mm breslow thickness superficial spreading mms associated with nevi in two cases, and one was a superficial spreading mm associated with nevus 2mm breslow thickness
  - in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy k epidermal shadow supplementary figure s4 online, defined as large featureless area with blurred border disrupting the normal epidermis and corresponding to the horizontal clefting due to hyporeflective stroma, ulrich et al
  - therefore, the subset of actinic keratoses imaged was preselected
  - therefore, the cases consisted predominantly of bccs and melanocytic tumors there were insufficient numbers of sccs and actinic keratoses to allow development of accurate rcm diagnosis of the latter tumors
  - therefore, 19 actinic keratosis, 12 bowens disease, and 2 sccs have been pooled together

File: Melanoma 5.pdf
Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.87
Negative Examples:
  - overall, dermal melanocytic nevi were found associated with 1126 of 1954 primary ssmnm 57
  - 69 mm were associated with dermal nevi, whereas in the thickness range 1
  - when melanomas were separated by nevus type, it was found that 41 were associated with an acquired pattern nevus, 38 with congenital pattern nevus, and 21 with dysplastic nevus
  - 2 the congenital pattern nevus extends between reticular dermal collagen bundles and is closely associated with appendages, especially pilosebaceous units
  - by the preceding definitions of melanocytic nevus, 42 of the ssm type were associ ated with acquired pattern nevi, 35 were found to have a congenital pattern nevus, and 24 were associated with a nevus showing features of dysplasia
  - of the 94 nm tumors, 38 were associated with acquired pattern nevi, 60 with congenital pattern nevi, and only 2 with dysplastic nevi
  - histologic dermal nevus associated with the melanoma was found in 57
  - numbers of melanoma cases associated with dermal melanocytic nevi as a function of tumor thickness tumor thickness mma total cases of melanomab cases associated with nevus  o0
  - correlation of melanocytic nevus type associated with histogenetic types of melanoma nevus type ssm  nm  total  acquired 298 42 36 38 333 41 congenital 248 35 56 60 304 38 dysplastic 168 24 2 2 171 21 total 714 94 808 vol
  - other types, such as acral lentiginous melanoma or those arising in lentigo maligna, were seldom found associated with nevi in a preliminary search of the data base, and they would only account for a maximum 1015 dilution
  - friedman et al 30, who studied 557 patients with primary malignant melanoma, specifically excluded melano mas associated with histologic evidence of congenital as opposed to acquired melanocytic nevi they also found that 23 of their series had histologic evidence of an acquired melanocytic nevus in association with the melanoma
  - 76 mm were associated with precursor nevi
  - incidence of nevus type and histogenetic type in ssm associated with nevi, 42 are of the acquired type 35 are congenital nevi, and 24 show features of dysplasia
  - in the case of nm, 38 were associated with acquired pattern nevi and 60 were associated with congenital pattern nevi
  - only two cases 2 of nm were found to be associated with dysplastic nevi
  - although this is somewhat higher than the present study, which found 24 of ssm excisions associated with dysplastic nevi, black also found only 9
  - 6 of these tumors associated with nevi may be somewhat elevated by the proportion of thin tumors in this series, but the frequency of almost twothirds of melanoma with thicknesses less than 1
  - 70 mm associated with dermal nevi indicates that the majority of melanomas may be associated with precursor nevi

Negative Examples:
  - comparing equal or thinner than 1 mm melanomas and thicker ones, epidermal disarray, cells in sheetlike structures, cerebriform nests and nucleated cells within dermal papilla were significantly associated with thick melanomas
  - no lesions excised for cosmetic reasons or solely due to a patient request were included

File: Melanoma 8.pdf
Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.89
Negative Examples:
  - we therefore constructed composite indices of sun exposure during child hood and during adulthood, assuming additive combinations of melanoma risk associated with each indicator of sun exposure
  - logistic regression modeling showed that the melanoma risk associated with a given level of sun exposure during adulthood increased with higher sun exposure during childhood, but the increase in risk was higher than the simple addition of melanoma risk associated with sun exposure during childhood or adulthood
  - we thus suggest that sun exposure during child hood and during adulthood would be interdependent as far as their impact on melanoma risk is concerned
  - table i lists the indicators relating to sun exposure that emerged as associated with an increased melanoma risk at the p 5 0
  - history of nonmalignant skin disease that lasted for 1 year or more was associated with a reduced risk of melanoma, probably because subjects who suffered from serious skin disease were generally more inclined to adopt sun protection behavior patterns
  - indicators for which the highest melanoma risk were attained also included the fewest subjects therefore, their conï¬dence intervals cis are larger than for the other indicators
  - for instance, the increase in melanoma risk associated with grant sponsor commission of the european union grant number 91cvv011770 grant sponsor conseil general du rhoËne, france
  - another example was the addition of the risk associated with sunscreen use to the risk associated with duration of holidays in sunny areas autier et al
  - the indicator sunscreen use comprised 2 levels of risk because psoralen sunscreens were a mixture of regular sunscreen and 5methoxypsoralen, and thus the melanoma risk associated with the presence of 5methoxypsoralen had to be considered supplementary to the risk associated with the use of regular sunscreens autier et al
  - , subjects with good table i  melanoma risk associated with sun exposure indicators in belgium, france and germany 199119921 sun exposure risk factors adjusted or 95 ci risk factors during childhood 014 years old2 1
  - the most probable explanation for these observations is that sun protection during childhood induced a better awareness of the dangers associated with exaggerated exposure to sunlight autier et al
  - thus, although potential and actual sun exposure during childhood may have been high, it did not necessarily imply a high level of sun exposure during adulthood
  - 2, suggesting a relative excess risk due to interaction of 4
  - a relative excess risk due to interaction was also found for the other levels of increased child and adult sun exposure in table iv
  - table ii  melanoma risk associated with indices of sun exposure during childhood and during adulthood indices added to basic model1 all subjects skin phototype iiiiv skin phototype iii adjusted or 95 ci adjusted or 95 ci adjusted or 95 ci sun exposure during childhood low no risk factor3 1
  - our index of sun exposure during childhood was based on broader data, and thus, probably that lesser recall bias was associated with that index than when relying only upon the sunburn experience
  - if this were the case, the melanoma risk associated with sun exposure during childhood and during adulthood would simply add their effects, and there would not be a relative excess risk due to interaction
  - for instance, some studies done in countries with yearround high ambient ultraviolet irradiation and high melanoma incidence, such as australia, found low melanoma risk associated with sun exposure, with risk levels situated between 1
  - in contrast, melanoma risk associated with sun exposure was often found to be above 2
  - therefore, in those areas, the extra amount of intermittent sun exposure needed to accomplish the ultimate steps for mela noma occurrence would be small compared to populations living in northern europe or canada
  - in the latter areas, intermittent sun exposure during childhood must be supplemented with higher amounts of intermittent sun exposure during adulthood to achieve the carcinogenic processes leading to melanoma
  - as a result, and because of the difficulty in assessing sun exposure during early life, in australia, the melanoma risk associated with intermittent sun exposure during adulthood may have appeared as relatively low, whereas it was found to be higher in northern europe or canada
  - , nonfamilial cutaneous melanoma incidence in women associated with sun exposure before 20 years of age

Probability Melanoma is Harmful: 0.84
Negative Examples:
  - only recently, a further metaanalysis involving 4579 patients data from seven randomized clinical trials revealed no signiï¬cant difference between narrow 1e2 cm and wide 3e5 cm excision margins in locoregional or distant recurrence, metastasis, death, or death due to melanoma 15
  - acral and mucosal melanomas lentiginous acral and mucosal melanomas have often poorly deï¬ned margins and are multifocal leading to discrepancies between the clinically visible and histo pathologic margins
  - therefore, surgical excision is usually attempted with increased safety margins at least 1 cm or by narrow margins with micrographic control e
  - consequently, 80 of the clnd performed might have been avoided 37
  - oligometastatic disease in patients with oligometastatic disease, ablative srs or equivalent radiotherapy represents a treatment alterna tive to surgery in cases where surgical access is associated with a high risk of signiï¬cant surgical complications
  - the literature provides only limited evidence for the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases 72 whole brain radiotherapy wbrt may cause serious longterm cognitive toxicity and therefore increased focus on srs has emerged 73
  - adjuvant ipilimumab 10 mgkg was associated with immunerelated adverse events iraes in 94 of the patients, and 5 patients died
  - 4 in the placebo arm, with one death in the pembrolizumab arm due to myositis
  - the combination therapy was associated with more toxicity than nivolumab alone
  - 13 with nivolumab 19 of the patients in the combination arm discontinued therapy due to ae compared to 6 in the nivolumab arm
  - 5 weeks in the ipilimumab and nivolumab arm, with treatment discontinuation being mostly due to high grade toxicity, rfs after 24 months was 70 for nivo lumab plus ipilimumab, compared to 42 for nivolu mab and 14 for placebo, resulting in a hr of 0
  - in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm, 71 of patients expe rienced treatmentrelated grade 3e4 aes compared to 27 in the nivolumab arm 62 of the patients dis continued treatment due to ae in the combination arm, compared to 13 in the nivolumab arm and there were no treatmentrelated deaths
  - the d Ã¾ t combination was associated with pyrexia grade 1e2 in 97 with chills in 37 and grade 3e4 pyrexia in 5
  - the high rate of pyrexia associated with d Ã¾ t can be reduced by using the management algorithm investigated in the combiaplus trial
  - treatment discontinuation associated with ae was seen in 15
  - the challenge is thus to ï¬nd the patients who will relapse whatever their ajcc group, using other bio markers
  - thirdly and ideally, a neoadjuvant treatment could lead to a complete response conï¬rmed by histo pathology and therefore major surgery might not be mandatory at all
  - therefore, the lower dose of ipilimumab was chosen for future trials
  - therefore, the longterm trial results need to be considered as a com bination of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant treatment
  - therefore, pdl1 expression determination should not be mandatory and should not be considered for ther apeutic decisions in stage iv melanoma
  - this is probably due to the signiï¬cant number of different ckit mutations and the lack of consistency of response even when the same mutation is present
  - in a general manner, the factors associated with shorter os included male sex, cerebellar involvement, higher number of metastatic brain tumors, concurrent recommendation 28 systemic therapy for brain metastases consensusbased recommendation level of recommendation a in eligible patients with brain metastases, combined immunotherapy shall be offered as ï¬rstline therapy
  - local therapy melanoma often metastasizes to the brain, which is associated with a worse prognosis
  - in the checkmate 067 trial, 91 patients in the nivo lumab arm received subsequent systemic therapy with ipilimumab, but the survival beneï¬t associated with this second line was not reported
  - therefore, when possible, the combination therapy should be preferred
  - the process of producing tils is technically chal lenging, and concomitant administration of il2 is associated with signiï¬cant toxicity
  - in acral melanoma, treatment with antipd1 n z 330 was associated with signiï¬cantly better os at 12 months 53 than patients treated with antictla4 therapies n z 94 34 survival at 12 months, p  0
  - therefore, in met astatic acral melanomas, mutation diagnosis should al ways be performed and the possibility of therapy with brafmek inhibitors should be considered as in other subtypes of melanoma
  - therefore, all statements, in particular on diag nostic and therapeutic procedures, can only correspond to the scientiï¬c knowledge current at the time of print ing of this guideline
  - this publication was conceptu alized mainly due to advances in the medical treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma, which justify a newer multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy
  - a higher radiotherapy dose is associated with more durable palli ation and longer survival in patients with metastatic melanoma
